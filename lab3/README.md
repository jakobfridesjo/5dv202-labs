# Lab 3: XQuery/XPath

*You may work in pairs.*

Using the attached XML data, answer the attached questions in XQuery/XPath. You
are free to use any XQuery/XPath operation you wish, but, in general we
recommend that you keep things as simple as possible. Once you are finished,
fill in your answers in the file and upload the file to labres.


*Note:* The lab requires [BaseX](http://basex.org/) (already installed on the CS linux computers).


* The questions (and the file to be handed in) can be found here: [lab3.xml](lab3.xml)
* The data can be found here: [sr.xml](sr.xml)

## Usage

* Download the lab3.xml and sr.xml files.

* Two examples on how to run the queries:
    * Terminal
        * Run basex -o answer.html lab3.xml
        * Open answer.html in a browser/text editor
    * BaseX GUI
        * Open basexgui
        * Open lab3.xml in basex, via Editor -> Open
        * Run your file by entering "RUN lab3.xml;" in the command area
